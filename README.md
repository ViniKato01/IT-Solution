This project was my second experience as a Web Developer (This one is organized hahah). I created this website to showcase the company's services, clients, and other important information in a professional and visually appealing manner.

Languages:

HTML: Includes sections like navigation, showcase, about, clients, features, products, testimonials, gallery, and footer.

CSS: Extensive CSS styling to ensure the website is visually appealing and responsive.

JS: Enhance the user experience with smooth scrolling and a sticky menu.

It was also my first experience applying JS along with HTML and CSS.
